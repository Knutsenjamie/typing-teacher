PROJECT OUTLINE

USER INTERFACE
  Display full text above
  Field for user to type
  Detect user keystrokes
  Change styling of text when correct/incorrect



BUSINESS LOGIC
  Evaluate if each letter is correct
    input from user (keystroke)
    comp against string / per keystroke

    COUNTERS NEEDED
    totalKeystrokes
    numberCorrect
    Accuracy = numberCorrect/totalKeystrokes

    let counter = 0; <-- can be inside game object/instantiate with constructor
     onKeystroke start compare()
      totalKeystrokes++;
      split string -> array
        array[numberCorrect] === current keystroke
      grab array location that matches counter
      evaluate against keystroke input
      pass if true 
        numberCorrect++; -run array location comp off this variable
      fail if false 
        stuck in loop until they enter backspace char

console
cn

waitingForBackspace = false;
detect keystroke
-> your function to determine if correct
-> if incorrect disable the input box, -> waitingForBackspace = true;
-> process all keystrokes
-> when backspace is hit, enable input box -> waitingForBackspace = false;


['c','o','n','s','o','l','e']
is the letter typed === 'c'

gather keystroke each press advances this

  Calculate accuracy
  Game object? - keeps counts and string
  Save game state/data to localStorage (stretch)
